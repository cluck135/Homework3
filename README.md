This projects title is Password Generator and it is a website that I coded the javascript for using my new found javascript coding skills so that it follows acceptance criteria. 

## Languages

Used javascript to code the backend of this website.

## Objective

- When prompts appear, user is able to select which criteria they want including numnbers, special character, and upper/lowercase letters
- When prompted for password length the user can only select a password betwen 8 and 128 characters
- When user answers each prompt the answer is validates otherwise it re asks the question
